In this project, we will analyze the Netflix user data to gain insights into users' watching habits. We will perform data cleaning, visualization, and analysis using Python and its libraries.

## Dataset

The Netflix user data can be downloaded by following these steps:

1. Login to your Netflix account.
2. Click on your profile icon and select "Account."
3. Under the "Profile & Parental Controls" section, click on "View" next to "Viewing activity."
4. Click on the "Download all" button to download your watch history as a CSV file.

## Libraries Used

We will be using the following libraries for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis in our Jupyter Notebook:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Please make sure these libraries are installed before running the Jupyter Notebook.
